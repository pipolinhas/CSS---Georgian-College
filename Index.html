    <h1>Last Night - Morgan Wallen</h1>

    <p>Last night we let the liquor talk<br>
    I can't remember everything we said but we said it all<br>
    You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met<br>
    But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet<br></p>

    <p class="chorus">No way it was our last night<br>
    I kiss your lips<br>
    Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips<br>
    Last bottle of Jack we split a fifth<br>
    Just talk about life goin' sip for sip<br></p>

    <p>You, you know you love to fight<br>
    And I say shit I don't mean<br>
    But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me<br></p>

    <p>I know that last night we let the liquor talk<br>
    I can't remember everything we said but we said it all<br>
    You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met<br>
    But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet<br></p>

    <p class="chorus">No way it was our last night<br>
    No way it was our last night<br>
    No way it was the last night that we break up<br>
    I see your tail lights in the dust<br>
    You call your momma, I call your bluff<br>
    In the middle of the night, pull it right back up<br></p>

    <p>Yeah my, my friends say let her go<br>
    Your friends say what the hell<br>
    I wouldn't trade your kind of love for nothin' else<br>
    Oh baby, last night we let the liquor talk<br>
    I can't remember everything we said but we said it all<br>
    You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met<br>
    But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet<br></p>

    <p class="chorus">No way it was our last night, we said we'd had enough<br>
    I can't remember everything we said but we said too much<br>
    I know you packed your shit and slammed the door right before you left<br>
    But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet<br></p>

    <p class="bridge">No way it was our last night<br>
    No way it was our last night<br>
    I know you said this time you really weren't coming back again<br>
    But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet<br></p>

    <p class="chorus">No way it was our last night<br>
    No way it was our last night<br></p>
